EDP consists of the following:

- The platform based on managed infrastructure and container orchestration;
- Security covering authentication, authorization, and SSO for platform services;
- Development and testing toolset;
- Well-established engineering process and EPAM practices (EngX) reflected in CICD pipelines, and delivery analytics;
- Local development with debug capabilities.
